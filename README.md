# Silent Camera Capture Failure in Expo with react-native-vision-camera

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo Camera API, used in conjunction with the react-native-vision-camera library, fails to capture photos or videos without producing any console errors.  This occurs even with proper permissions. The bug.js file shows the problematic implementation. The bugSolution.js file provides a possible workaround.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using `expo start`.
4. Attempt to take a picture or video.  Observe that no image or video is captured, despite no apparent errors.

## Potential Causes

The root cause is likely an incompatibility or timing issue between Expo's Camera API and react-native-vision-camera. Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact mechanism.
