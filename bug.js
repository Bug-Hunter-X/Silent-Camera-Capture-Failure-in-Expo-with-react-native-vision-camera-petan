This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API in conjunction with the react-native-vision-camera library.  The issue manifests as an inability to capture photos or videos, even when the necessary permissions are granted and the camera functionality appears to be initialized correctly. The console may show no errors, making debugging difficult.  This is often seen when switching between camera modes or after a period of inactivity.
